looking at Deno

what happens is once the connection to the rsyslog server is made the node application will cache all the attemps from the start of it 
which means everyone gets the same page
not real time yet
one solution is to restart node every couple hours

another thing I can do is set options for either NGinx access logs or ssh errors

sudo awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
